###### Roles: Programmer.
###### Developed in: Simple DirectMedia Layer, C++.
A game engine made by me to be used for C++ projects. It includes all functionality required to quickly get into game developing without worrying too much of the more complicated functionalities. It also includes a game which exhibits how to implement elements like graphics and gameplay logic.

## Tech Summary
* Made in C++.
* Powered by SDL2.
* Can easily be adjusted for other libraries.
* Includes comments which explains purpose of features.
* Modifiable.
* Includes gameplay features such as AI, player input, win-lose criteria, and game modes.
* Background process such as rendering, animation, and audio already implemented.
* Beginner friendly.
* Pong VS Pacman is made in this engine.
* The Race Card is made in this engine.
* Dice Invaders is made in this engine, with different library.
* Includes readme file with introductions.

## Insights
I have mostly been working with Unity3D/Unity2D and UDK, where game engines are already available and only game logic is missing. I wanted to try my hands on creating my own game engine which skips most of the more technical stuff and focuses more on adding gameplay, similar to aforementioned game engines. I also wanted to expand my knowledge of C++, since most of my projects are C# oriented. With a robust game engine, I can easily create 2D games and let other people create their own 2D games by skipping most of the complex technical part of it.
